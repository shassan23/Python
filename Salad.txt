Sophie zesty salad example:
oranges = 6
limes = 1
lemons = 1
bananas = 10
apples = 20

(oranges + limes + lemons) > (apples + bananas) 
salad must include oranges and limes 
lemons or apples
NOT (bananas) and NOT (grapes)

-----------------------------
My salad: 
oranges = 12
limes = 2
lemons = 1
bananas = 10
apples = 20
grapes = 4
cantelope = 1
mangoes = 3

(oranges + limes + grapes + mangoes) > (apples + bananas) 
salad must include oranges and limes 
lemons or apples
NOT (lemons) and NOT (cantelope)

--------------------------------------------

psuedo code (hybrid between human and computer language):

ingredients for tropical fruit salad
mangoes = 5
watermelon = 10
kiwi = 1 
guava = 2 change to 3
papaya = 3 change to 3
no bananas 
no lemons

fruit salad rules: 
mangoes.count > kiwi.count = TRUE 
mangoes AND guava = TRUE 
guava.count == papaya.count = FALSE so change it to same number on ingredients list
guava.count == papaya.count 
watermelon OR kiwi = TRUE 
watermelon.count > mangoes.count = TRUE 


.count is to figure out the number of fruits
AND OR <> is the operator
